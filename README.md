A simple golang rest api which create the note functionalities.
In assignment, I had to built the single api to fetch the data for two dates.
Here I have created the whole crud application along with the  assignment apis 

# How to run the app on local machine

> #### Clone the repo on local
> #### For backend I am using the mysql docker image
> #### so running the image please run this command from repo
> - `` docker compose up ``
> - using hot reloading so you can run the api with command 
> - inside repo run 
> ``air``
> - I have included he postman collection so you directly import into postman and test it.
``Note App.postman_collection.json``
